Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9=15 The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9=17 Their absolute difference is 2

Function description

Complete the diagonal difference. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.
